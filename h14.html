            Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13 or Global Goal 13) is to limit and adapt to climate change. It 
            is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. 
            The official mission statement of this goal is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts".
            SDG 13 and SDG 7 on clean energy are closely related and complementary.<br>

            SDG 13 has five targets which are to be achieved by 2030. They cover a wide range of issues surrounding climate 
            action. The first three targets are outcome targets: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related 
            disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and capacity to meet climate 
            change. The remaining two targets are means of implementation targets.To implement the UN Framework Convention 
            on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management. Along with 
            each target, there are indicators that provide a method to review the overall progress of each target. The UNFCCC 
            is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.<br>

            Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges made
            under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.<br>

            As of 2020, many countries are now implementing their national climate change adaptation plans 
            SDG 13 intends to take urgent action in order to combat climate change and its impacts.<br>

            Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease,
            and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.<br>

            Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming. Additional warming will 
            increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.Under the 2015
            Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges made under the
            Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.<br>

            Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This 
            change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other 
            types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use.
