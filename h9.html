            Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8 or Global Goal 8) is about "decent work and economic growth" and is one
            of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals which were established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.
            The full title is to "Foster sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment 
            and decent work for all."Progress towards targets will be measured, monitored and evaluated by 17 indicators.<br>

            SDG 8 has twelve targets in total to be achieved by 2030. Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The first 
            ten are outcome targets. These are; "sustainable economic growth; diversify, innovate and upgrade for economic productivity",
            "promote policies to support job creation and growing enterprises", "improve resource efficiency in consumption and production",
            'full employment and decent work with equal pay', 'promote youth employment, education and training', 'end modern slavery, 
            trafficking, and child labour', 'protect labour rights and promote safe working environments', 'promote beneficial and 
            sustainable tourism', universal access to banking, insurance and financial services. In addition, there are also
            two targets for means of implementation, which are: Increase aid for trade support; develop a global youth employment strategy.<br>
                     
            For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in Gross Domestic
            Product (GDP). In 2018, the global growth rate of real GDP per capita was 2 per cent.<br>
            
            Over the past five years, economic growth in least developed countries has been increasing at an 
            average rate of 4.3 per cent.In 2019, 22 per cent of the world's young people were not in employment, 
            education or training.
