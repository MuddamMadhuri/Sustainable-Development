            Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17 or Global Goal 17) is about "partnerships for the goals." One of the 17 Sustainable 
            Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, the official wording is: "Strengthen the means of 
            implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development".SDG 17 refers to the need for 
            the nonhegemonic and fair cross sector and cross country collaborations in pursuit of all the goals by the year 2030.
            It is a call for countries to align policies.<br>

            SDG 17 is a vision for improved and more equitable trade, as well as coordinated investment initiatives to promote 
            sustainable development across borders. It is about strengthening and streamlining cooperation between nation-states, 
            both developed and developing, using the SDGs as a shared framework and a shared vision for defining that collaborative 
            way forward.It seeks to promote international trade and an equitable trading system.The Goal has 17 targets to be 
            achieved by 2030, broken down into five categories: finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systemic issues. 
            Progress towards targets will be measured by 25 indicators.All these targets are regarded as means of implementation 
            targets.<br>

            With US$5 trillion to $7 trillion in annual investment required to achieve the SDGs, total official development 
            assistance reached US$147.2 billion in 2017. This, although steady, is below the set target.In 2016, six 
            countries met the international target to keep official development assistance at or above 0.7 percent of gross 
            national income.In 2017, international remittances amounted US$613 billion, with 76 percent invested in developing 
            countries. The bond market for sustainable business is also growing. In 2018 global green bonds reached US$155.5billion,
            up to 78 percent from 2017.<br>

            Humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters have continued to demand more financial resources 
            and aid. Even so, many countries also require official development assistance to encourage growth and trade.
            The global progress map for SDG 17 shows that significant and major challenges remain in the majority of the world.
            Many regions of strong economic status perform very poorly, like the United States and much of Europe.<br>

            The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations to be implemented 
            by the year 2030. A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private 
            sector and civil society. These inclusive partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and 
            shared goals that place people and the planet at the center, are needed at the global, regional, national and local level.<br>

            Sustainable Goal 17 targets long-term investments to empower sectors and companies in need, more adaptable in 
            developmental countries. Its main aim reaches improving the following aspects of a country that include: energy,
            infrastructure, transportation systems, IT infrastructure to different communications technologies channels.<br>

            The framework of development covers evaluating and following up with rules and regulations, the sector's structure 
            to attract more investment projects to the country and thus improving its economical standards.<br>
