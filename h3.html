            Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2 or Global Goal 2) aims to achieve "zero hunger". It is
            one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official
            wording is: "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture".
            SDG 2 highlights the "complex inter-linkages between food security, nutrition, rural transformation and 
            sustainable agriculture".[3] According to the United Nations, there are around 690 million people who are hungry,
            which accounts for slightly less than 10 percent of the world population.[4] One in every nine people goes to bed 
            hungry each night, including 20 million people currently at risk of famine in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria.<br>

            SDG 2 has eight targets and 14 indicators to measure progress.The five outcome targets are: ending hunger and improving 
            access to food; ending all forms of malnutrition; agricultural productivity; sustainable food production systems and 
            resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals;
            investments, research and technology. The three means of implementation targets include: addressing trade restrictions
            and distortions in world agricultural markets and food commodity markets and their derivatives.<br>

            Under-nutrition has been on the rise since 2015, after falling for decades.This majorly results from the various stresses
            in food systems that include; climate shocks, the locust crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Those threats indirectly reduce
            the purchasing power and the capacity to produce and distribute food, which affects the most vulnerable populations and 
            furthermore has reduced their accessibility to food.<br>

            The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. "The signs of increasing hunger and food insecurity are a
            warning that there is considerable work to be done to make sure the world "leaves no one behind" on the road towards a 
            world with zero hunger."It is unlikely there will be an end to malnutrition in Africa by 2030.<br>

            Data from 2019 showed that "globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing
            countries. Under nutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide".
