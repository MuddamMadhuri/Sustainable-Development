    <h2>VANMAHOTSAV</h2>
    <p>Tree plantation is necessary to increase an area's green cover and vegetation.
         Trees are home to flora and fauna, and we are destroying their habitat by encouraging deforestation. 
         It is essential to understand that practising afforestation in mass numbers will eventually lead to the growth 
         of an economy.</p>
         <p>LPU has organised a wonderful opportunity to save our mother earth by planting 100 trees </p>
         <p>The campaign will be held on 29<sup>th</sup>march, 2024 near agriculture block timing will be from 2pm to 5pm.</p>
