            Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15 or Global Goal 15) is about "Life on land". One of the 17 Sustainable Development 
            Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, the official wording is: "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use 
            of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and 
            halt biodiversity loss".The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 14 
            indicators.<br>

            The nine outcome targets include: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; end deforestation and 
            restore degraded forests; end desertification and restore degraded land; ensure conservation of mountain ecosystems, 
            protect biodiversity and natural habitats; protect access to genetic resources and fair sharing of the benefits; eliminate 
            poaching and trafficking of protected species; prevent invasive alien species on land and in water ecosystems; and 
            integrate ecosystem and biodiversity in governmental planning. The three means of implementation targets include: 
            Increase financial resources to conserve and sustainably use ecosystem and biodiversity; finance and incentivize 
            sustainable forest management; combat global poaching and trafficking.<br>
                        
            An annual report is prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations evaluating the progress towards the 
            Sustainable Development Goals.It provides data on changes in forest areas, desertification, biodiversity loss and 
            other parameters that are of relevance for SDG 15.
