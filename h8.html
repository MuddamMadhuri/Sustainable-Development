            Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7 or Global Goal 7) is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by 
            the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. It aims to "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and 
            modern energy for all."Access to energy is an important pillar for the wellbeing of the people as well as 
            for economic development and poverty alleviation.<br>
            The goal has five targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards the targets is measured by six indicators.
            Three out of the five targets are outcome targets: Universal access to modern energy; increase global percentage
            of renewable energy; double the improvement in energy efficiency. The remaining two targets are means of 
            implementation targets to promote access to research, technology and investments in clean energy; and expand and 
            upgrade energy services for developing countries. In other words, these targets include access to affordable and 
            reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. They also focus on improving 
            energy efficiency, international cooperation and investment in clean energy infrastructure.<br>
            According to a review report in 2019, some progress towards achieving SDG 7 is being made, but many of the targets 
            of SDG 7 will not be met.SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action) are closely related.<br>
            SDG 7 is tackling the problem of the high number of people globally who live without access to electricity or
            clean cooking solutions (0.8 billion and 2.4 billion people, respectively, in 2020). Energy is needed for many 
            activities, for example jobs and transport, food security, health and education.<br>
            People that are hard to reach with electricity and clean cooking solutions include those who live in remote
            areas or are internally displaced people, or those who live in urban slums or marginalized communities.
