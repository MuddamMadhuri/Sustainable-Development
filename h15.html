            Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Goal 14 or SDG 14) is about "Life below water" and is one of the 17 Sustainable 
            Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is to "Conserve and sustainably 
            use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development".[1] The Goal has ten targets to be achieved by 
            2030. Progress towards each target is being measured with one indicator each.<br>

            The first seven targets are outcome targets: Reduce marine pollution; protect and restore ecosystems; reduce ocean 
            acidification; sustainable fishing; conserve coastal and marine areas; end subsidies contributing to overfishing; 
            increase the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources. The last three targets are means of 
            implementation targets.To increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for ocean health; support small 
            scale fishers; implement and enforce international sea law.One indicator (14.1.1b) under Goal 14 specifically relates
            to reducing impacts from marine plastic pollution.<br>

            According to the 2020 report on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, "current efforts to protect 
            key marine environments and small-scale fishers and invest in ocean science are not yet meeting the urgent need to 
            protect this vast, fragile resource".<br>

            Life below water is Goal 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals, set to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, 
            sea and marine resources for sustainable development.Currently the state of our oceans are declining due to 
            climate change factors and human behaviour.<br>

            The deterioration of coastal waters is increasing due to both pollution and coastal eutrophication. Similar factors 
            contribute to climate change, negatively affecting the oceans and marine biodiversity which is slowly declining.
            The threat of growing algal blooms and dead zones in the oceans are alarming; in 2018 it was stated that "without 
            concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20% of large marine ecosystems by 2050".<br>

            A recent report states ocean acidification reporting stations have tripled worldwide since 2021, in addition to 1 
            in 5 fish caught from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Beach clean-ups across the coasts are shedding 
            light on the increase in ocean plastic pollution which suffocates the seas.<br>

            Marine conservation, local livelihoods and resource sustainability measures are compromised by poor decision-making
            in resource management.Consistent efforts are being made to improve such management."The sustainable management of 
            our oceans relies on the ability to influence and guide human use of the marine environment".To counter regression 
            in achieving Goal 14, "swift and coordinated global action is imperative".
