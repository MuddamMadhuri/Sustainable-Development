                        Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4 or Global Goal 4) is about quality education and is among the 17 Sustainable 
                        Development Goals established by the United Nations in September 2015.[1] The full title of SDG 4 is "Ensure 
                        inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all".<br>
                        SDG 4 has ten targets which are measured by 11 indicators. The seven outcome targets are: free primary and 
                        secondary education; equal access to quality pre-primary education; affordable technical, vocational and higher 
                        education; increased number of people with relevant skills for financial success; elimination of all discrimination 
                        in education; universal literacy and numeracy; and education for sustainable development and global citizenship. 
                        The three means of implementation targets[3] are: build and upgrade inclusive and safe schools; expand higher education 
                        scholarships for developing countries; and increase the supply of qualified teachers in developing countries.<br>
                        SDG 4 aims to provide children and young people with quality and easy access to education plus other learning 
                        opportunities. One of its targets is to achieve universal literacy and numeracy. A major component in acquiring 
                        knowledge and valuable skills in the learning environment. Hence, the urgent need to build more educational facilities 
                        and also upgrade the present ones to provide safe, inclusive, and effective learning environments for all.<br>
                        Major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the primary school level, for both boys 
                        and girls. In terms of the progress made, global participation in tertiary education reached 224 million in 2018,
                        equivalent to a gross enrollment ratio of 38%.
