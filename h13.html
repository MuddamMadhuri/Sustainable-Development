            Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12 or Global Goal 12), titled "responsible consumption and production", 
            is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording of SDG 12 
            is "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns".[1] SDG 12 is meant to ensure good use of resources, improve 
            energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure, provide access to basic services, create green and decent jobs, and 
            ensure a better quality of life for all.SDG 12 has 11 targets to be achieved by at least 2030, and progress towards 
            the targets is measured using 13 indicators.<br>

            Sustainable Development Goal 12 has 11 targets. The first 8 are outcome targets, which are: implement the 10‑Year 
            Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; achieve the sustainable management and 
            efficient use of natural resources; reducing by half the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer 
            levels and the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses; achieving 
            the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle; reducing waste generation 
            through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse; encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices; promote public 
            procurement practices that are sustainable; and ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness 
            for sustainable development. The three means of implementation targets[3] are: support developing countries to strengthen 
            their scientific and technological capacity; develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts; and 
            remove market distortions, like fossil fuel subsidies, that encourage wasteful consumption.<br>

            Countries are working towards the implementation of the "10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption 
            and Production Patterns".[<br>

            To ensure that plastic products are more sustainable, thus reducing plastic waste, changes such as decreasing usage 
            and increasing the circularity of the plastic economy are expected to be required. An increase in domestic recycling 
            and a reduced reliance on the global plastic waste trade are other actions that might help meet the goal.<br>
            
            Changes in consumption and production patterns can help to promote the decoupling of economic growth and human 
            well-being from resource use and environmental impact. They can also trigger the transformations envisaged in 
            global commitments on biodiversity, the climate, and sustainable development in general.
