            Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5 or Global Goal 5) concerns gender equality and is fifth of the 17 Sustainable 
            Development Goals established by United Nations in 2015. The 17 SDGs recognize that action in one area will affect 
            outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            <br>
            SDG 5 has nine targets and 14 indicators. Six of the targets are outcome targets:
            <ol>
                <li>ending all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.</li>
                <li>ending violence and exploitation of women and girls.</li>
                <li>eliminating harmful practices such as child early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.</li>
                <li>increasing value of unpaid care and promoting shared domestic responsibilities.</li>
                <li>ensuring full participation of women in leadership and decision-making.</li>
                <li>access to universal reproductive rights and health.</li>
                </ol>
The three means of implementation targets are:
<ol>
    <li>fostering equal rights to economic resources, property ownership, and financial services for women.</li>
    <li>promoting empowerment of women through technology.</li>
    <li>adopting and strengthening policies for gender equality, and supporting legislation to enforce it.</li>
</ol>
Through the pledge to "Leave No One Behind", countries have committed to fast-track progress for those furthest behind first.
SDG 5 aims to grant women and girls equal rights and opportunities to live free of violence and discrimination, 
including in the workplace.<br>

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected women as they are more vulnerable and have reduced access to treatment.Evidence shows
there has been an increase in violence against women during the pandemic.
