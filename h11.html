            Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Goal 10 or SDG 10) is about reduced inequality and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development 
            Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The full title is: "Reduce inequality within and among countries".<br>
            The Goal has ten targets to be achieved by 2019. Progress towards targets will be measured by indicators. The first seven 
            targets are outcome targets: Reduce income inequalities; promote universal social, economic and political inclusion; ensure 
            equal opportunities and end discrimination; adopt fiscal and social policies that promotes equality; improved regulation 
            of global financial markets and institutions; enhanced representation for developing countries in financial institutions;
            responsible and well-managed migration policies. The other three targets are means of implementation targets.
            Special and differential treatment for developing countries; encourage development assistance and investment in least 
            developed countries; reduce transaction costs for migrant remittances.<br>
                       
            Target 10.1 is to "sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the 
            national average". This goal, known as "shared prosperity", is complementing SDG 1, the eradication of extreme poverty,
            and it is relevant for all countries in the world.There has been a growth in income for poorer people in 2012â€“2017. 
            Nevertheless, it is common in many countries that "the bottom 40 per cent of the population receive less than 25 per cent 
            of the overall income".<br>
            
            A UN report from 2020 pointed out that "women are more likely to be victims of discrimination than men".And the situation
            is even worse for women with disabilities.<br>
            Inequality exist in various forms, such as economic, sex, disability, race, social inequality, and different forms of 
            discrimination.Measuring inequality in its individual forms is a crucial component in order to reduce inequality within 
            and among countries. The Gini coefficient is the most frequently used measurement of socioeconomic inequality as it can 
            significantly show the income and wealth distribution within and among countries.<br>

            Issues associated with health, pollution, and environmental justices are often inseparable with inequality. Sometimes
            these issues also associated with indigenous and aboriginal communities, ethnic minorities and communities of low 
            socio-economic status (SES).Studies of environmental justice shows these communities are irregularly likely to live in 
            environments with higher risk of exposure to pollution and toxic contamination, which possess long-term health and 
            environmental threats.<br>

            Globalization is also accompanied with migration, displacement and dispossession, and this often increased vulnerability 
            of marginalized communities and groups, which negatively shaped their prospects for globalization and emancipation and
            widened inequality at the meantime.[11] There are also association between inequality and mental and physical health in
            various forms, such as status anxiety/competition, social capital, social embeddedness and cohesion.
