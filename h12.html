            Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11 or Global Goal 11), titled "sustainable cities and communities", is 
            one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The official 
            mission of SDG 11 is to "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable".The 17 SDGs take into account that 
            action in one area will affect outcomes in other areas as well, and that development must balance social, economic 
            and environmental sustainability.<br>

            SDG 11 has 10 targets to be achieved, and this is being measured with 15 indicators. The seven outcome targets include
            safe and affordable housing, affordable and sustainable transport systems, inclusive and sustainable urbanization,
            protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage, reduction of the adverse effects of natural disasters, 
            reduction of the environmental impacts of cities and to provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces.
            The three means of implementation targets[4] include strong national and regional development planning, implementing 
            policies for inclusion, resource efficiency, and disaster risk reduction in supporting the least developed countries 
            in sustainable and resilient building.<br>

            3.9 billion people—half of the world's population—currently live in cities globally. It is projected that 5 billion people
            will live in cities by 2030.[6] Cities across the world occupy just 3 percent of the Earth's land, yet account for 60–80 
            percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. There are serious challenges for the viability and 
            safety of cities to meet increased future demands.<br>

            SDG 11 addresses slums, human settlement management and planning, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and 
            urban economies. Prior to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, Millennium Development Goal 7, target 4, called for efforts
            to achieve a "significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers" by 2020.<br>

            There has been a rapid growth of mega-cities, especially in the developing world: "In 1990, there were ten mega-cities 
            with 10 million inhabitants or more, and in 2014, there were 28 mega-cities, home to a total of 453 million people".
            With regards to slums, data shows that "828 million people live in slums today and most them are found in Eastern 
            and South-Eastern Asia".<br>

            SDG 11 represents "a shift in international development cooperation from a focus on poverty as a rural phenomenon
            to recognizing that cities, especially in the global south, are facing major challenges with extreme poverty, environmental
            degradation and risks due to climate change and natural disasters"
