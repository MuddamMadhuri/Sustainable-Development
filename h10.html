            Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Goal 9 or SDG 9) is about "industry, innovation and infrastructure" and is one of the
            17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.SDG 9 aims to build resilient 
            infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.<br>

            SDG 9 has eight targets, and progress is measured by twelve indicators. The first five targets are outcome 
            targets: develop sustainable, resilient and inclusive infrastructures; promote inclusive and sustainable 
            industrialization; increase access to financial services and markets; upgrade all industries and infrastructures 
            for sustainability; enhance research and upgrade industrial technologies. The remaining three targets are means 
            of implementation targets[4]: Facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries; support 
            domestic technology development and industrial diversification; universal access to information and communications technology.<br>
            
            In 2019, it was reported that "the intensity of global carbon dioxide emissions has declined by nearly one 
            quarter since 2000, showing a general decoupling of carbon dioxide emissions from GDP growth".Millions of people 
            are still unable to access the internet due to cost, coverage, and other reasons.It is estimated that just 54% 
            of the world's population are currently (in 2020) internet users he aim of attaining inclusive and 
            sustainable industrialization is to "unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment 
            and income".This goal includes striving for resilience (engineering and construction) and urban resilience.<br>
            
            SDG 9 recognizes that humanity's ability to connect and communicate effectively, move people and things efficiently,
            and develop new skills, industries and technology, is crucial in overcoming the many interlinked economic, social 
            and environmental challenges in the 21st century.<br>
        
            In order to have a successful community, a functioning and strong infrastructure has to be in place as its basic 
            requirement.SDG 9 is all about promoting innovative and sustainable technologies and ensuring equal and universal 
            access to information and financial markets.<br>

            The technological development in infrastructure is what gives rise to a sustainable society.This is expected to
            create prosperity and jobs, and build stable and prosperous societies across the globe.The key emphasis is on 
            developing reliable and sustainable infrastructural solutions that support economic development as well as human 
            well-being, while also ensuring financial affordability.This goal aims at ensuring every society in the world
            possess good infrastructure.<br>

            Achieving SDG 9 will require significant financing and political will. Key challenges include improving internet 
            access in developing countries, inadequate transport, (particularly in land-locked developing countries) and the 
            disparity of Research and Development investment and the number of researchers in developing countries when 
            compared to developed countries.
