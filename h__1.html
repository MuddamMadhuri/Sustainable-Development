        Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1 or Global Goal 1), one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the
        United Nations in 2015, calls for the end of poverty in all forms. The official wording is: "No Poverty". Member countries
        have pledged to "Leave No One Behind": underlying the goal is a "powerful commitment to leave no one behind and to reach 
        those farthest behind first".<br>
        SDG 1 aims to eradicate every form of extreme poverty including the lack of food, clean drinking water, and sanitation.
        Achieving this goal includes finding solutions to new threats caused by climate change and conflict. SDG 1 focuses not
        just on people living in poverty, but also on the services people rely on and social policy that either promotes or 
        prevents poverty.<br>
        The goal has seven targets and 13 indicators to measure progress. The five outcome targets are: eradication of 
        extreme poverty; reduction of all poverty by half; implementation of social protection systems; ensuring equal rights to 
        ownership, basic services, technology and economic resources; and the building of resilience to environmental, economic 
        and social disasters. The two targets related to means of implementation SDG 1 are mobilization of resources to end 
        poverty; and the establishment of poverty eradication policy frameworks at all levels.<br>
        Despite the ongoing progress, 10 percent of the world's population live in poverty and struggle to meet basic needs 
        such as health, education, and access to water and sanitation.Extreme poverty remains prevalent in low-income countries,
        particularly those affected by conflict and political upheaval.In 2015, more than half of the world's 736 million people
        living in extreme poverty lived in Sub-Saharan Africa.[8] The rural poverty rate stands at 17.2 percent and 5.3 percent in 
        urban areas (in 2016).<br>        
        One of the key indicators that measure poverty is the proportion of population living below the international and national 
        poverty line. Measuring the proportion of the population covered by social protection systems and living in households with
        access to basic services is also an indication of the level of poverty.</p>
